# go-chd
wrapper for chdman to convert isos in bulk

I wrote the first one in shell, and then thought how hard could it be to write in go. Practice project to get back into go.

### TODO
 * add globbing so I can decompress single/groups of files instead of directories
 * add a force flag to overwrite previously written CHDs
 * get stats to print out correctly when it finishes
